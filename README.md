## Key Attributes:
    1. Logistic Regression model is used for binary classification
    2. Model classified news(True/Fake) with 94.5% accuracy
    3. Identified key patterns shown by fake news and clickbaits
    4. Proves to be useful to both readers and tech companies involved in the issue.

## Problem Statement: 
The project is concerned with identifying a solution that could be used to detect and filter out sites containing fake news for purposes of helping users to avoid being lured by clickbaits. It includes a web based GUI for accepting "Author Name" and "News Content".

## Data Source

* [Fake News Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data)

## Methods
* Data preprocessing
* Train & Test split
* Stemming
* Feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer
* Logistic Regression Model
* Evaluation
* Deploy using Flask
  
## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
* Python 3.10
* Pandas
* nltk (Natural Language Processing)
* TfidfVectorizer (Feature extraction)
* Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
* Flask

## Lessons learnt:
* How and when to use Logistic Regression?
* How to stem text data?
* How to extract features from text data (TfidfVectorizer)?
* How to deploy a machine learning model using Flask?

## What to do next?
* Create a better looking web UI.
* Use other models instead of Logistic Regression and compare the accuracy scores.
